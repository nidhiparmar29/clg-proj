# Freelancer Shiny App

I developed an application using R Shiny that matches data science freelancers to jobs based on their preferences, skills, and profile text. You can use the app [here](https://robinsones.shinyapps.io/Job_Shiny_App/). 

The code and dataset needed to deploy the application are all in this repository. If you're interested in viewing the Python code of how I gathered, cleaned, and explored the data, please see [my other repository](https://github.com/robinsones/Data-Science-Freelancers).
