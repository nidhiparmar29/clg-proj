NSAR_DAT_2014_Q2.csv. This is example output in .csv format, which contains both properly processed data and improperly processed data that needs attention. See below for more info. 3. Several MATLAB .m files showing how I started the project for your reference. You do not need to use MATLAB to perform this project. In fact, Perl or Python may be preferable, but I am less proficient in those so I chose MATLAB. 4. fields.txt. Tab-delimited file with the output format of the 29 fields, descriptions, data types, and source for the data - i.e. how to find the data in the raw .txt files. 5. formn-sar.pdf, formn-sar.txt. This is a PDF and a TXT version of the form that is filled out electronically by mutual fund companies. This is what users are looking at when they input the data. This is helpful sometimes to interpret the data when it is not structured the way you expect or have previously processed. Detailed requirements.Overall:Process the provided .txt files (approximately 58,000 of them total from 1996-2015) into a single, standardized flat file dataset in .csv format, compressed via Zip or Gzip. Input:I will provide a zip file (or tar.gz file if preferred) of the ~58,000 files to be processed along with the form_YYYY_QQ.csv files (4 per year, 1996-2015) which has a list of the files by Year and Quarter. This file has the fund name, CIK, and date of filing, which is necessary information in the final deliverable. Note that the last field, files, includes a path. This path was its download location at the SEC, and you simply need the file name at the end of the path. Deliverable: Final dataset should contain 29 fields, with field names in the first row and data following beginning on the second row. Data specification is in fields.txt, and example deliverable data is in NSAR_DAT_2014_Q2.csv. This example has both correctly and incorrectly processed data in it.Correctly processed data: Example 1: lines 2-8, ""360 Funds"" set of data. Example 2: lines 11-25, ""AdvisorOne Funds"" and ""Advisors Inner Circle Funds""There is more, I just highlight these as correct.Incorrectly processed data:Example 1: lines 9-10, missing fund name. In this case, there is only one fund, so name should be copied over to FundName.Example 2: lines 26-124, there are 99 series numbers but 4 funds and 5 tickers, and rows are not assigned properly. The data in line number 101, 108, and 119 should be instead in line 27, 28, and 29 just below the first line of data. The remainder should be deleted.Example 3: lines 367-375, these are blank and should be removed.There are more examples as well, and more ways in which data may be incorrect. This is a straightforward project, so I expect to pay the full price upon completion of the deliverable. If you are successful, I may need to repeat this project as this data continues to be collected by the SEC and I may want to update my dataset. Also, I have an additional task to merge this data (likely using mutual fund company and mutual fund name) with my existing dataset. Those projects will be listed separately, but you will be the leading candidate if you are successful here.

The majority of the time spent working on this project will likely be understanding and figuring out our system.  If you are good with formulas this should be an EASY project.  If you are not good with formulas, you will likely waste both of our time.

Explanation of sheets 	Product Data: New Product Data for each style of shoe 	Merged Data: Current e-commerce database, needs to be updated by merging Product Data, and re creating new SKU format.  	Layout: Sheet that holds the codes/keys for color and style name.  (100 = Kayano 22)	Extra Style: Unnecessary sheet that also holds keys/colors.  This sheet needs to be eliminated.  The purpose of these sheets is to merge Product Data with the Large Data sheet.  The Large Data sheet has the individual shoe variations, in different colors and sizes.  The Product Data sheet has the primary information about each style (material, type, ankle height, etc).  We want to merge the Product Data sheet into the Large Data sheet. In creating the SKU on the Large Data sheet, both sheets must be used.  In the Product Data sheet, gender and style name are necessary components.  The color and size are the components from the Large Data sheet.  One of several current issues with the sheet is that it is unable to distinguish between male and female shoes of the same style.

My dissertation focuses on improving our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the aging process to develop novel ways for delaying, stopping and hopefully reversing their adverse effects in order to extend our lifespan and health-span. Since I am legally blind, I cannot perform experimental wet-lab work efficiently.  That is why my direct research approaches, methods, analysis and activities are pretty much limited to those, which can be performed electronically on computers, because  in contrast to wet-lab data  computers can be made more accessible for the visually impaired by using screen reader and screen magnification software, such as Zoomtext (see http://www.aisquared.com/products/).  Therefore, In order to graduate I need to predict, which manipulations, e.g. changing the gene expression pattern, protein abundance distribution, epigenetic alterations, environmental conditions; nutrient composition and abundances, etc. could extend lifespan.  Due to lack of funding we cannot generate our own data.  Hence, in order to publish in peer-reviewed journals we depend on already publically available information and databases for making new discoveries, which have not already been made by their original publishers.   We use the yeast as model organism because my adviser has a yeast lab, in which he can validate my predictions.  If I can show my adviser strong enough supporting evidence that a certain predicted longevity manipulation could indeed extend the lifespan in yeast, then he will make this manipulation (e.g. knocking out or over-expressing genes accordingly) in his yeast lab.  If he can show that this can indeed extend lifespan, then I can graduate.The teaching materials, e.g. electronic textbooks, slides, exercises, assignments, homework, tutorials, solutions,, projects, commands, review sheets, etc., which are needed for my genomics, bioinformatics, machine-learning and network analysis classes, are available in digital format online or on my hard drive.

With the current set of regular expressions we have, about 22% of news articles are getting classified.  We want to increase the proportion of articles that get classified automatically to at least 50%.  At the same time, we want to maintain good accuracy with the regular expressions.  So that at least 90% of the automated classifications are accurate.  So the challenge is to balance making the regular expressions relatively greedy/broad to maximize their coverage potential, but without sacrificing accuracy.  I have tried a few different approaches for doing this, and so far the method that seems to be most efficient is to focus on articles whose headlines suggest a particular category and to have the regex operate on the headline only.  The metric that is important at this stage is what coverage boost (percent) are we getting per minute spent analyzing articles and creating Regexes?

I am looking to have an algorithm created that will be able to use multiple internet sources to pull data and correlate them into facts. The algorithm will mine data and aggregate it into useable information that can be searched using keyword terms similar to the way google searches. For example (this is just an example)If there was a story that recently was on the news that was about an earthquake in japan. I would want the algorithm to be able to search all of the  major credible news sources and gather any stories about a recent earthquake in japan and decide that they are all the same story using the time and date it was reported as well as the time data in the story. Then I would like the algorithm to cross check facts using all the information from those sources about that story and put those facts into a database that could later be searched. When someone does a search of the database information I want them to be able to search by things like keyword terms as well times. For example if someone searched something like show me any earthquakes that happened in japan in the last 7 days, the information that we gathered would be displayed along with the time and date that it happened, where it happened, all the pertinent information, as well as the sources that we pulled the data from along with the url's that the data came from which would act like a bibliography.

The only skills really needed for this task are some basic abilities to use a free image processing tool called GIMP (Gimp.org). You do not need to know anything about GIMP before hand. I have produced a video tutorial showing the complete steps you will need to take to complete this task.

No real skill is involved in performing this task. There is just a lot of images to go through.I will be providing detailed instructions and a set of sample images to show what each type of object you will be identifying looks like. I would like to get a few different people working on this. I will provide a small batch of files initially so I can verify your work before continuing. For each batch of images I will be looking for 5 main things.1. Verify that the segmentation is good. The segmentation outline does not have to be perfect, but I would like for it to be reasonably close. You will need to be able to quickly produce a good segmentation.2. The labels must be correct. Having plants incorrectly labeled will seriously degrade the ability to train the network. 3. That no plants above a certain size are missed4. That the filenames are correct.5. Overall time per image. If you are really slow at performing this task I will try and find someone else who can produce quality results at a better pace.I will hand out each assignment in batches and verify work before proceeding to the next batch. Cost is an issue for me on this project. I need lower priced entry-level people for this task. So if your hourly rate is too high then I will not consider you for this job. I do want quality work though, so your rate needs to be high enough that you feel comfortable with the level of pay.In my tests I was able to do about 50 of the simple images that only had a couple of plants in them within an hour.

However, we refined the scope of the job because previous one was too ambitious and not accurate enough on how we wanted to work on. We have decreased the scope of the job, but with more details on how to proceed.Before developing the complete stack, we need to check if the document recognition is feasible or not, what processing should be done.We have identified several steps to be done :1) Define the image processing and the Tesseract configuration required to extract relevant information from a scanned document.2) Maybe a training phase for Tesseract.3) Define the image processing to correct problems coming from smartphones picture (wide-angle lens, parallax, screwing)Here we will focus on the first step only. However, if the collaboration is good and the results are good, we will keep working on the next steps with the hired person.What is asked The approach we would like to follow is :- Using Tesseracts confidence score to determine a several image processing methods,- Using a key - value method to extract the relevant fields. You can see that on the attached documents, information are prefixed with a key (C.1.3, P.1. ) It means that the preprocessing phase is an iterative process. Several OCR passes are used in loop with different image-preprocessing parameters filters ; best result is selected by confidence. Tesseract provides confidence in OCR result for each recognized word.Youll have to:- Define several image processing,- Write a script to preprocess an image (as above) and provide the recognition of the relevant information (as hash).For information : during our first tests, we find out that using a leveling on a grey-level image, with a Tesseract trained for French gave interesting results.How to processWe will provide you several scanned document to use as inputs. As they are official documents, we will provide them only after we agree to work together.The sample images here are for information and their quality is poor. Better pictures, non obfuscated, will be provided to you before working on.We have also detected restrictions on the value fields (alphanumeric, numeric, list values ...)DeliverablesYou should provide us :- The script ( our preference is python, tell us if you have another preference),- The configuration of Tesseract,- The processed images,- Documentation on how to install, run the script, the dependencies- Information about stable errors.We hope to not have stable errors in Tesseract recognition. But if we face this issue, it wont mean the project will be refused. It means that well have to do another training step.In fact, we are trying to find out the specific font used on the document in order to train Tesseract for this font.Well validate your findings by processing the images with the provided script and running the OCR against the processed images.Other non-functional specifications- The OS should be Ubuntu,- Youll have to use the latest Tesseract version, trained for French,- The script should be in python, - The only requested interface is command line.",Image recognition with Tesseract and OpenCV,30+ hrs/week,Belgium,0.0,7,0,VERIFIED,0

Along this journey some of the key milestones the programme enables adolescents to achieve are:1. the completion of secondary education2. improved literacy and numeracy3. Improved life skills (particularly perceived self-efficacy, resilience and aspiration)4. improved employability skills5. employmentIn achieving these milestones, Magic Bus believes that it empowers young people with the competencies and skills that they need to move out of poverty. At this stage, Magic Bus seeks the support of a skilled economist/ statistician to validate the process by which SROI is calculated. Some of the above milestones are quantified using evidence trends from the UN and World Bank, and an extrapolated estimate of the contribution Magic Bus makes to the life of a young person has been calculated.

I have attempted some of this so far by proactively monitoring this but I will like to create a passive system for achieving as much of this as I can. Someone who also has an interest in 'the quantified self' or 'hacking' productivity and health would be ideal for this project. I'd love to carry on this project myself but I'm running out of time and occasionally is technical knowledge that I require and I don't always have time to learn it.  We will have to talk on Skype to really understand this project further.  This will really require someone to think for themselves.  I won't be able to offer constant instructions or to micro-manage.  You just need to understand my goals and make it happen. I would like to measure multiple daily metrics for actions and habits and automatically add this information to a single spreadsheet online (on google drive or whichever other provider is recommended).  If you can recommend a better way of measuring this other than an online spreadsheet I'd be open to that idea to. I'd like the spreadsheet to be able to compare metrics against each other. Depending on how complex spreadsheet allows us to be, it would be great to have a pivot chart or graphs for some information.Currently use the following smartphone apps and triggers for various habits and actions. Utilising something like IFTTT, Yonomi, Launch Centre etc I would like to be able to quantify actions and usage in one single spreadsheet.I've attempted this a few times using IFTTT however so far I have only been able to add information to separate spreadsheets which doesn't help in bringing everything together in one place and and comparing information.The ultimate goal is to be able to see (hopefully visually) patterns or correlations between metrics. For example amount of hours spent at work versus hours of sleep the night before. Previous night's sleep versus use of the headspace app (meditation), or hours of sleep versus productivity (if it's possible for a Zapier or IFTTT link to Rescue Time)This project will require a lot of communication by Skype and will be best described in initial conversation. I'm keen to find a person who has the technical know-how and interest themselves in this kind of thing so that you might understand what I'm trying to achieve. Also if you can recommend any other great apps, habits, or measurements that are aligned with my goals that would be appreciated.Apps currently in use are:Headspace (daily meditation)Diaro App (writing in a diary)Inner Balance (similar to meditation)UP (Jawbone) - for measuring sleep. It also measures step count which might be handy but am more interested in sleep.Wireless tag (motion detection on my front door to measure how much time I spent a home)IFTTT (or a better alternative) - for monitoring location such as time spent at work, or any other information metrics that can be gathered.I also have a few apps to automate my home such as Sonos, Wmeo (for heaters) and LIFX (all currently run by Yonomi). At this stage any work with these workflows are not in scope for this project, but there might be a requirement later on.This this project is listed as an ongoing project as I foresee that will take a while and I'll need to do testing and provide feedback and new requests. There is no hurry for this project but I'm finding that I don't have time to do the necessary research and information myself. Or some finding that I don't quite have the knowledge on integration codes that IFTTT uses, or the URL codes that other apps used to communicate.I've also found that IFTTT only runs a check on their server every 15 minutes. This means that accurate measurements and immediate triggers are not possible. If you have an alternative such as Zapier this would also be welcomed. I have read that using emails as a trigger in IFTTT will cause instant triggering but I haven't investigated further.If you're interested in this long-term, ongoing project please respond with the term 'quantified self' in the subject line. This project will be long-term and sometimes slow moving as there will no doubt be periods when I am travelling for work or too busy to respond immediately.

The person we previously hired was unable to continue working for us, so we have a half completed project.  We have a large e-commerce product database that we are working on building new SKUs for.   Previously, identical styles were named with varying names.  For example, the shoe named New Balance 777 might be named1. New Balance 7772. 777 NB3. 777 New BalanceThis was our biggest problem in joining these different style names into one SKU.  I have done the work of making a excel file with each of these names next to what it SHOULD be, (New Balance 777), which is how it is in Product/Style Information sheet.   One column consists of the old style names, and the column next to it has the new style names (all represented in the Product Data sheet).1. Raw Data Sheet2. Product/Style Information3. Style Numbers and Color Numbers4. Old Style Names/New Style names (This sheet will be eliminated)1. Raw Data SheetContains all of our data on the Linnworks software.   This is all of our ecommerce data.  2. Product/Style InformationEach style is a unique row with its own data.  This sheet will merge into sheet #1.  3. Style Numbers and Color NumbersEach unique style name in sheet #2 & sheet #1 (should be identical) is given a number.  4. Old Style Names/New Style NameThis sheet contains all of the names from the original data that we want to replace with our new data.    The end goal of this project was to restructure our SKUs based on style name.  Our expectations are to have these three sheets work in unison, allow for the modification of style data (sheet #2) which will then be placed into the primary data sheet (sheet #1).Much of this work is already done  the formulas, SKUs, and so forth.  We need someone to clean up our Excel file, ensure that the style names are registered to unique values, reduce loading time for calculations (if possible), and to finish this project.  I would estimate that over 75% of this project is already completed.  Upon completion of this work we have a project that directly involves this exact data.  The next step of this project is to upload this file to Linnworks, our inventory database system.

The reason I choose Google Sheets is because it will allow me to share my segments with other people in my team. The first task I have is as follows:I want to track the number of people who make it through the various steps of my marketing funnel, and I want to see this as two numbers: the percentage of people who made it from one page to the next, and the number of people who made it from the first page to the current page. The funnel look like this:Lead Gen PageThank You PageMarketing Page 1Shopping CartUpsell 1Upsell 2 (with transaction ID in the URL)We can track most of the pages just by looking at the URL's that people land on, but the final page is the hardest to track, because I want to know if they purchased Upsell 1. If they do, they will have a transaction ID added to the end of the URL, so we only want to see people who have it. However, we do currently have this tracked in Google Tag Manager for Facebook conversions (https://www.dropbox.com/s/eorn40zb75bgl00/Screenshot%202016-08-22%2012.06.48.png?dl=0), so you should imagine you can duplicate it to your liking. Once we have this set up, I would like to see the conversion rates for each steps added to a new row every day inside Google Sheets, so we can then go and create our own graphs for them. That will allow me to visualise the changes more freely. It should look something like this:DATE     |     CR from Page 1     |     CR from previous page1-1-15      |              5.4%             |                   27.6%1-1-16      |              6.4%             |                   37.3%Providing this job is completed successfully, we will then focus on building more dashboards related to ecommerce, and UTM parameters.

I have expertise in building front office investment solutions and using those solutions as a financial analyst.  This is a test project. I'd like an expert to help me think through the beginning of a longer term big data project.  This should be fairly enjoyable to you guys.  I'm looking for a small time commitment right now and would like you to help me brainstorm.Here's the basic idea.  I want to create a fairly simple ETL architecture that can pull in data from a variety of sources / formats.  Right now the two in question will be Yahoo Finance Data and Twitch.tv data have RESTful json APIs that should make things fairy easy.  But I want to build with the flexibility in mind and to eventually support unstructured data.  Basically I could run a simple script and pull this into a MySQL database, but I want build this as if it were a long term solution for a larger agenda.The part I need help with is thinking through the technologies I should use as well as what the ETL pipeline architecture should look like.  I'm sure many of you have worked on Big Data analytic projects and have learned a lot in the process.  At first, all I'm looking for is an adviser.  Someone that can give me some pointers or tips.  Someone I could pay a couple of hours for their time.  That said, over time, I would see the relationship expanding into something more interesting.  I'd like to use Google Cloud Platform over AWS but I'm pretty naive.  I'm much less familiar with GCP and have created a few test projects to get use to the platform.  To me AWS feels too heavy for this project.  If you're going to build an enterprise solution you'd go with AWS, their new Kinesis Firehose, Hadoop, etc.  However, I want to keep it really simple and I'm not as familiar with non-relational database.  I'm not oppose to something like that but I'm looking to start pulling in data sooner rather than later.I'd like to use Python or Java as the ingestion language.  I'm familiar with both and am learning towards Python.  So a couple questions I'd like to answer in your time with me.1.  GCP or AWS bearing in mind simplicity in the architecture is key.2. Technologies, scripts, workflows that I need to go from data ingestion to pushing it into data storage, to cleaning, to analyzing and potentially computing proprietary numbers.3. If there is a potential to package sell finalized analytic data, I need reliability, security, backups.  4. Data architecture / etc5. Tips / learning tools that helped you and could help me get up and running quick.One important requirement is fluent English.

Measurement theory is based on the idea that latent constructs cause the measured variable and that the error term is uncorrelated within measured variables. In a measurement model, an arrow is drawn from the measured variable to the constructs.- Design the study to produce the empirical results: In this step, the researcher must specify the model.

Theseelements could be anything  numbers, characters, strings, etc. There is no particular orderof the elements in a set  e.g. set S1 = {1, 2, 3} is equivalent to set S2 = {2, 1, 3}. Set theory isthe branch of mathematics that studies sets, and it has many applications in real life. Someof these applications include: relational databases  e.g. MS SQLSERVER, MySQL, etc.;computer graphics; basis of relations and functions; graph data structure; and many more.In the set theory, we can apply a set of key operations including: membership,subset/superset, union, intersection, difference, complementation, Cartesian product, andpower set. Below we quickly explain the key set operations:1. Membership. An element e belongs to a set A, if it is a member of A2. Subset. A is a subset of a set A, written A  B or B  A, if every element of Abelongs to B.3. Superset. A is a superset of another set B, if all elements in B belongs to A.4. Powerset. P is a power set of A, if P is the set of all subsets of A5. Intersection. A  B of two sets A, B is the set of all elements that belong to both Aand B6. Union. A  B of two sets A, B is the set of all elements that belong to A or B7. Set Difference. A  B of two sets B and A is the set of elements of B that do notbelong to A.8. Symmetric Difference. of two setsAandB. Is the set of elements in A or B, but notin both (not in the intersection)  elements in A only or B only but not in A  B.9. Complement. of a set A is the set difference (see number 7) between U (universalset is the set of all possible elements) and set A  elements in U, but not in A.10. Cartesian Product. A *B is the set of all pairs (a,b) where a belongs to A, and bbelongs to B.Task specificationWe want to implement a generic collection class, SetClass, that represents a set ofelements, and implement the set operations explained above. The SetClass shouldimplement the above 10 set operations as follows:1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)SIT221  PROJECT 1 3SIT221  DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS  PROJECT 1  DUE 5PM FRIDAY AUGUST 12THSetClass&lt;T&gt;Data:Add necessary dataMethods:+ Membership(T element): bool+ IsSubsetOf(SetClass&lt;T&gt; B): bool+ IsSupersetOf(SetClass&lt;T&gt; B): bool+ Powerset(): SetClass&lt;SetClass&lt;T&gt;&gt;+ IntersectionWith(SetClass&lt;T&gt; B): SetClass&lt;T&gt;+ UnionWith(SetClass&lt;T&gt; B): SetClass&lt;T&gt;+ Difference(SetClass&lt;T&gt; B): SetClass&lt;T&gt;+ SymmetricDifference(SetClass&lt;T&gt; B): SetClass&lt;T&gt;+ Complement(SetClass&lt;T&gt; U): SetClass&lt;T&gt;+ CartesianProduct&lt;T2&gt;(SetClass&lt;T2&gt; B): SetClass&lt;Tuple&lt;T, T2&gt;&gt;+ Add any necessary methods and/or properties* Note: The Cartesian product method can be applied on sets of different types.

I am focusing on client behavior and intersection with stores and the Internet.What I would like to do is:1. List all 1,000 physical stores (each with a unique ID) in a column2. Source from our Oracle database, the number of clients who have visited that store ID In the last 12-months, as well as how much money they spent3. Then, using that client group for each store, I want to show how many of those clients shopped at any of the other 999 stores and what was their spend:Eg. Store 0001 - 10 total clients, $1,000 spend at Store 001; 4/10 spend at $25 at Store 00022/10 spend $140 at Store 00030/10 spend at Store 0004, etc.4. Additionally I would like to compare how many of Store 0001s clients shopped online and how much did they spend online. However, instead of treating the online store as just ONE point of purchase, I would like to split the Online orders by market so that each individual market would have its own client count and sales total.To do this: I would source the number of clients who have shopped online in the last 12-months, and cluster these clients and sales by the Market within which the order was delivered. Eg: DMA123 250 clients shopped online, $4,000 spend; DMA456 320 clients shopped online, $5,500 spend, etc.5. By doing this, I am hoping to treat the web sales of each market almost as if it's a physical location. Doing this, we could show which physical stores the online clients also shop at.I am hoping that these steps in theory would produce a final product that looked like a list of stores and markets down Column 1, that same list of stores and markets across Row 1, and the cross-shop overlap client count and spend in the grid below Eg:<<<<>>> 0001 0002 DMA123 DMA4560001        100%   0%     34%       16%0002          0%  100%    43%       20%DMA123    34%  43%  100%        0%DMA456    16%  20%     0%       100%So, now that I've laid out the conceptual idea - my question to you is if you would be able to write a code to do just this, if I supply to you just the data sources, the variables to use, and the unique IDs to reference? I would not be able to pass data.Please let me know your thoughts or if you would like to discuss further.Thank you!Joe",SAS Programming - CRM Analytics,Less than 10 hrs/week,United States,0.0,1,0,UNKNOWN,0

Now that we're close to delivering our product and continue to generate pre-orders, we're looking to understand our customer base a tad bit better. We launched a survey to 1800 customers and received 500 responses back. We'd love it if someone could help us data mine and extract info from this precious information. We are looking to target customers on social media and find creative ways to reach them; we think we can achieve this if we take a closer look at the survey. Since we're a two-man show and are focused on manufacturing, we can't do this ourselves right now. That's why we need your help. Ideally, the right person will help us dig through this data and make sense out of it - either by placing information into buckets based on customer personas or illustrate it in some fashion. We're pretty open to how the data gets compiled but it seems like there may be up to 7-8 types of customers. Being able to identify each one will be essential. Here is a link to our kickstarter campaign if you'd like to check it out. http://kck.st/1QodNaL. Once we approve our contract on UpWork, we will share the results with you.

Looking for: a talented individual with multiple skill sets, including: 1) the ability to program in a software language (I'm agnostic which) that can sort large data sets, 2) perform simple mathematical equations with the data, 3) can dynamically update the data based on internet inputs (API), and 4) provide the necessary output (for instance in a GUI or spreadsheet). I am building: a platform that pulls data from a website's API, places it into a database, and then resorts the data based on my proprietary formula/algorithm (a fairly basic sorting formula, technically speaking; I will provide this to you). The output is actually in similar format to the input, just resorted based on my algorithm. I've personally built a working prototype already on Excel which functioned well, but I want someone who can build an automated version of what I have, that will update automatically when new data on the source website becomes available. What I've been doing is copying/pasting the data into the Excel file, which given the amount of rows/ columns has been laborious and not practical. This is a financial project, specifically in the world of equities, so some rudimentary knowledge of finance, stocks, EDGAR/ SEC filings, etc is helpful, but not absolutely necessary - I can provide the necessary instruction on these topics if my chosen developer is green. If the end product could sit on a desktop and be user friendly - perhaps with a GUI, though that is not absolutely necessary - that would be nice. More than a technically challenging project, this one requires the individual to be trustworthy and have references that demonstrate an ethical character. I want the project done well in a reasonable amount of time, but it isn't a rush. I want the person to work efficiently, but also to enjoy the process, learn from each other, and bring my vision to fruition.

In many cases, the same user has requested multiple features to be added to the app.## THE TASK ##The goal is to find out how many times multiple features have been requested by the same user.For example:Michael has requested the following features:1. Search Function2. Multi-currency Support3. Multi-language SupportJohn has requested:1. Multi-currency Support2. Multi-language Support3. App WidgetPaul has requested:1. App Widget2. Multi-currency SupportThe results should be:Multi-currency Support and Multi-language support appear together 2 times (Michael and John have requested both of these features)Multi-currency Support and App Widget appear together 2 times (John and Paul have requested both of these features)Note: The example above shows only the frequency of two feature requests appearing together, however, Id like to know how many times any of the features appear together (i.e. how many times 3, 4, 5, etc. features appear together)## OUTPUT ##In a separate worksheet(s) on the same Google Spreadsheet, please display the results of the analysis in table form and in illustrative form (Venn diagram or any other graph/diagram that applies).The idea behind this task is to find out which features are most commonly requested together so they can be bundled into a package for users to purchase. **You will notice that there are many more features than the ones on the feature list sheet, however, the ones on said sheet are the only ones we are interested in",User Feedback  Feature Request Correlation - Structure Data,10-30 hrs/week,United States,4.8886327893,54,84,VERIFIED,45

Our data consists of data about rock samples, and images that we take under controlled conditions of the rocks. Goal is to various ML techniques including machine vision and Convolutional Neural Networks to process the images across several specific pre-defined methods, train with a growing body of cataloged rock sample images, and then process unclassified images and score them based on their similarity to the training data. We'll have actual trained ""experts"" (yes, humans) help train the data including new samples by reviewing the processed images either before processing (during training) and after processing to confirm or reject the outputs. The ""working"" system would require human intervention if classification predictions are below a threshold confidence interval, otherwise, would be accepted.Then we have a whole LOT of other data related to each rock sample, and we'd like to line up those data and see if we can determine other prespecified interpretations about our data.Strong proficiency in machine and deep learning methodologies, statistical analysis techniques (regression, etc) involved in machine learning, required.

These analyses and data visualisations/charts much provide the end user with not just an appreciation of the complexity of the number of dimensions to the data, but also that it can be interpreted.We are visualising virtual machine instances or cloud resources from cloud providers. You will be providing input to a data visualisation project with our lead analyst.A cloud resource is identified as a combination of the following attributes: Instance Type, Operating System, Tenancy, Region and Availability Zone.Types of input from the dataset that will be provided:1. Instance Type: Normally from 6 to 30 (or even more) different instance types are in use.2. Operating System: Normally no more than 2 or 3 different operating systems are in use across a large number of combinations Instance Type, Tenancy, Region and Availability Zone.  Potentially, there can be as many as 20 operating systems in use.3. Tenancy: Normally default only.  When both default and dedicated are being used, the spread is around 50% to 50%.  Note that for RDS instance types, tenancy is always default.  RDS instance types are denoted by the prefix db.4. Region: Normally from 1 to 5 different regions, but can be as many as 12 regions.5. Availability Zone: Normally up to 5 different availability zones for each region on EC2 instances types (i.e. 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e), up to 2 different regions on RDS instance types (either SingleAZ or MultiAZ).Ideally we would add a 6th dimension to the graphical representation: # of instances in use within the same cloud resource combination.  This might vary between 0 and 1 units for some combinations, between 0 and 1,000 units for others.The next step would be to visualise what happens if we were to migrate either some or all cloud resources, from one combination to another.

Based on this overview we need to write a literature review and then write a PhD dissertation proposal, which needs to be presented in the middle of August of 2016 and that can be completed within one year because I only have funding until May 15th, 2017.  Due to lack of funding, only publically available data are available to be used for analyses in my bioinformatics PhD dissertation research.  Possible websites to look for suitable datasets for analyses are: 1)	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/2)	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sraI am thankful for any additional suggestions. Possible aims of my bioinformatics dissertations are: 1.	Predicting genes or combinations of genes that when over-or under-expressed can extend lifespan preferably in yeast but also other species are possible.  We are interested in identifying changes in gene expression patterns that can be associated with an increased lifespan. 2.	Better understand how and why caloric restriction can extend lifespan in yeast.3.	Identifying the factors that are responsible for a queen bee to live for up to 4 years whereas their genetically identical worker bee counterparts only live for a few weeks. 4.	I am generally interested in making my bioinformatics dissertation a contribution to better understand and delay aging.  Any approach to accomplish this is very welcome.We can also define other aims if they are suitable for a bioinformatics PhD dissertation.  So if you are already good in any techniques, methods or approaches and would like to train me in how to use them for my dissertation, I am very interested in your suggestions.  Meta-analyses are also possible if we can find ways to compare data from different studies.

We would like to use our data to be able to provide families with 5-10 point percentile ranges (or an appropriate confidence interval, as I expect some will be quite wide) on each section of these unofficial exams by using diagnostic and final official test performance to norm the tests - to use the official percentiles we do have to estimate student's performance. These unofficial tests have the added wrinkle of being significantly easier than the real exams across the board, which makes disparate students bunch at the top in a way they will not on real exams. We would like all of our collected data to be analyzed to provide these new percentile curves for unofficial exams. All curves created will be vetted in-house to ensure quality.Next, we would like a new regression curve for predicting percentiles from each test by using the collected official data from this year and last year for each exam.We do not have the experience in-house to do this (regression curve excepted, but I would like a more accurate one), so I am reaching out to see if it is possible for this to be accomplished (preferably quickly).

Our trading entries and exits are in the millisecond range. We are seeking a data scientist/statistician to assist us to find certain patterns in bid/ask prices, which will assist us with predictions, based on statistical probabilities, for our trades. We will be using EUR/USD raw tick data for this experiment.Essentially, the problem is this:At certain times of the day, the difference between the bid price and the ask price (i.e. the spread), drops to zero or even goes negative. In some cases, the bid jumps up (or beyond) the ask, and at other times, the ask drops to (or below) the bid, (based on where the bid and ask was just prior to the zero spread event). Or the bid and ask may meet in the middle. We believe a zero spread (or negative spread) event marks some significance for market movement, i.e. up or down as there must be some price action causing major movement. The question is which way and how far does the price move and is there a pattern? Alternatively, a zero spread or negative spread event could just be market in-efficiencies in which case there may be no pattern at all. Our current theorem is that when a bid jumps up to the ask, (or above), that signals a large buying group moving the market up. We want to capture that movement with a quick scalping trade. But how far does it move and how long does it take? Similarly, if ask drops to or below the bid, we believe there is large selling pressure which would continue downward movement where we could short the market. We have certain questions the data scientist needs to answer to prove or disprove our theorem using the raw tick data provided. When a zero spread (or negative spread) event occurs, what price level does this occur in relation to the bid/ask just prior to that event? The definition of the ""prior event"" are the bid/ask figures which are 10ms, 50ms, 100ms, 500ms prior to the zero spread event. Please provide graphs/distribution curves. What happens after the zero spread event 50ms, 100ms, 500ms, 1 sec, and 2 sec after? Where is the bid/ask price at those periods? Is there a statistical correlation between where the bid/ask price was before the zero spread event, then the location of the zero spread event, and then bid/ask price after?For negative spreads, is there a correlation between the size of a negative spread and the subsequent price movement after the negative spread event. i.e. does a larger negative spread correlate to a larger price movement and in which direction?Are there any other machine learning techniques, neural networks, performance modelling or simulations you would suggest for our problem?","Big Data, Data Analytics, Data Mining, Pattern Recognition, Statistics of FX trading HFT data",10-30 hrs/week,Australia,5.0,26,17,VERIFIED,12
